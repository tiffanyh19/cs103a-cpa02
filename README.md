All images are located in the Screenshots of App folder. Apologies in advance as difficulties arose when trying to export them as an image. 

Explanation: 
clothes_shop.json contains the data that this project is based on. It contains the id of the clothing item, the name of the item, the category it belongs to, the price of the item and how many of the item is in stock. 

Clothing.js categorizes what type of variable each of the following qualities of clothes_shop.json is and makes the json file into a mongoose model. 


Index.ejs explains how to indicate whether the user wants to search their clothes by id marked on the item or the category of clothing they are searching for. 

cloth.ejs shows how the clothing item will appear on the website if it is the item is clicked on

clotheslist.ejs shows all the clothes in full display as a table with the above qualities (id, name, category, price stock)


app.js helps run the data from the previous ejs and json files into a executable website to be displayed for a user.
